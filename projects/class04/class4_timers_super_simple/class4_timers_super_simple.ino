/*
millis() function is built in the Arduino IDE/compiler
ms_runtime and one_ms_timer
were variables defined by US to help us keep track of 
timing... meaning how many milliseconds have gone by
*/

/*
lets take a look at a pseudocode to understand the function below

if one millisecond has passed then
	advance some variables to mark/count one millisecond
	*1ms counting*[programs falls in this part ~ once every 1 ms]
else if the max value of milliseconds is reached
	clear everything back to zero to avoid a overflow
else (this one is implicit)
	do nothing but wait patiently AND dont delay

if variable that increase in *1ms counting* section is more than 99
	which means that it counted 100 times 
	we use this as a tick of 100 ms 
	then


	increase all those variables that you are using to time events
	//those variables should have the word timer or letters tmr in them

else // this is not written down but just implicit
	when the if is not true, we do nothing.
	do nothing but wait patiently AND dont delay
