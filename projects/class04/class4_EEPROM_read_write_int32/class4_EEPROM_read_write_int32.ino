Description
Unsigned long variables are extended size variables for number storage,
and store 32 bits (4 bytes). Unlike standard longs unsigned longs won't 
store negative numbers, making their range from 0 to 4,294,967,295 (2^32 - 1)

/* Additional study

there are two places in the code where 
the program is locked in an infinite loop.

Program a specific LED flashing pattern in 
each of these infinite loops to distinguish 
where the program ends
