/*
for loop reference from https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/for/

initialization: happens first and exactly once.
condition: each time through the loop, condition is tested; if itâ€™s true, the statement block, and the increment is executed, then the condition is tested again. When the condition becomes false, the loop ends.
increment: executed each time through the loop when condition is true.
